# My Personal Portfolio

## Description
This project is my personal portfolio which will showcase all my future projects and works, which will eventually help me in future interviews and job offers. I have built this website using HTML and CSS, putting in practice the things I have learned such as: grids and nested grids, flexbox, responsive layout, modern colour scheme and other useful bits.

It was a real challenge to build a website from scratch, but I certainly learned a lot of useful things. One thing I can say is that practice is very important and you have to keep on trying.

# Challenges

I had multiple challenges during this project. I had to review my code multiple times in order to spot the mistake. Below, I have listed a couple of issues that caused me some trouble:

1. My first issue was whether to create a grid for the main content, or use a flexbox. So I have chosen the flexbox way as I thought it would be easier to style. Once I have done that, my main titles weren't aligned and I struggled for some time to figure out on how to align these titles. I have tried several options, played around with the margins and paddings but I still couldn't get this to work. Responsive was even worse as I had a big space on the right.

2. After several attempts, I moved on something else and I started creating the projects grid for the Portfolio Section. This was also another challenge as I couldn't get the images to display its full size. Luckily, I have looked at my previous activites and I made them to work and display nicely in the page.

3. Going back to the flexbox that I've created for the main content, after I've made the grid for Portfolio, my page was looking even more messed. So I have decided to rewrite my code from scratch, using a different approach. This time, I have made a grid for the main content.

4. For the main grid, it was also a challenge because I couldn't figure out why the Portfolio content was displayed on the right of the About Me section. After reviewing my code a couple of times, I realised that I had the class placed in the wrong section and its children were only 3 sections, whilst I was creating a grid containing 6 areas.

5. Responsive was my last challenge as I couldn't understand how to remove the paddings and margins applied on Web View. So I found some tricks on making it work and I finally made my website responsive.

# The Journey

1. I firstly started with the HTML code, I have added comments and created classes that I was gonna use for the CSS.![1  Screenshot - Writing HTML](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115581300/199294349-ebaf3dd7-e8ce-4b78-ade1-66e6171055d6.png)


2. Secondly, I have written and re-written the CSS code until I got this to work. This is the final version of my code![2  Screenshot - Writing CSS](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115581300/199294370-7e80434f-bd80-4988-ab23-6228dbd09ddf.png)


3. This is the HTML and CSS altogether![3  Screenshot - HTML linked to CSS](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115581300/199294384-061ea9e0-8257-43e2-a696-f07e5e4a8205.png)
